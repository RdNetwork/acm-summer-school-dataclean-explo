#ACM Europe Summer School 2017 - Labs deliverables repo

##Context

This repo contains the results of a lab performed at the ACM Summer School that I attended in Athens in JUly 2017. During this Data cleaning/exploration lab, the goal was to appropriately filter data using the OpenRefine software, using both clear guidelines from the advisor and our own guesses. The data used is a list of parking violations in the city of New York.
